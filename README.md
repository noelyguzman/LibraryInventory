Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Summary

**Library Inventory System** implement the hash map dat structure from the Java hashmaps collection and stored bookd titles as Strings and a boolean value represnting the book's shelf status. We are able to add, print, and toggle the status of a book in the system. 
My goals is to evntually imrpove the system by making the values of each key of "Book" type so that I can store more information and add more features such as a user, date it was checked out, and even duplicates." One major drawback is that we cannot have duplicate keys and, therefore, also not have duplicate books.
I also look to improve the user interaction aspect and evnetually implment a GUI.
